# SMB RNN TUTORIAL

In this tutorial, we will walk through replicating my work using Recurrent Neural Networks to generate Mario levels.

First you will need:

* python 2.7
* numpy
* keras  (and appropriate back end for keras, either TensorFlow or Theano)
* jupyter

You will also need to check out https://github.com/TheVGLC/TheVGLC.git or download the zip from https://github.com/TheVGLC/TheVGLC .  You will need to update the folder in the ipynb to point to the correct location.  

The ipynb is what you'll want to see.
